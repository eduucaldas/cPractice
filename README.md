Unrusting my c++

Hi there this is my repository for unrusting my C++! It's been a while, and I missed you C++.

-helloWorld: just a simple HelloWorld for the sake of completeness

-cracking_Oyster: Based on the first pearl of Programming Pearls, Jon Bentley, really recommend it ;)

--randomVector: Creates a n-vector with unique integer entries in [0, MAX_VALUE[, mainly for testing. Uses the Fishe-Yates Shuffle

--sort: Implements the idea gave by the book, that uses a bitset to do things super quick(O(n)) and with less memory

--testSmall, testBig: they test the sort with our randomVector to provide input. Small is for checking correctedness and Big for efficiency.

--More details: I invite you to read the Programming Pearls :)
